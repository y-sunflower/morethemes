This document explains everything you need to get started using **`morethemes`**.

<br>

## `mt.set_theme()`

`mt.set_theme()` is the **main function** you'll need. It basically has 2 arguments:

- `theme_name`: the name of the theme you want to apply. It must be one of the available themes: _"wsj"_, _"urban"_, _"minimal"_, _"ft"_, _"nature"_, _"economist"_, _"retro"_, _"yellowish"_, _"darker"_, _"monoblue"_.
- `reset_to_default`: whether to reset to default matplotlib theme before applying the theme. If not, themes can stack on top of each other. Default is `True` (and recommended).

Once the function is called, it will apply the theme to the **global matplotlib configuration**. You can reset to default theme by calling `mt.set_theme("default")`

```python
import morethemes as mt

mt.set_theme("wsj") # Wall Street Journal
```

## `mt.get_rcparams()`

You can get the current rcParams of a given theme by calling `mt.get_rcparams()`. It takes one argument: `theme_name` and returns a dictionary of rcParams.

```python
import morethemes as mt

wsj_rcparams = mt.get_rcparams("wsj")
```

Then you can apply them to your matplotlib configuration with:

```python
import morethemes as mt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

wsj_rcparams = mt.get_rcparams("wsj")
plt.rcParams.update(wsj_rcparams)
```

Another usage of this function is to avoid adding **`morethemes`** in your dependencies. Just copy the output of `mt.get_rcparams()` and paste it in your code.

## `mt.preview_theme()`

A convenient function when creating a theme. It will make many different charts and you'll easily be able to view how your theme currently looks like. Learn more in [create your theme page](../create-your-theme/).
